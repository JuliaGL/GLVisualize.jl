Example showing a basic interactive setup for working inside the REPL/Atom/Jupyter.
It also shows how to not clear what has been drawn. Note that this is currently
not working correctly and generates cool smoke like artifacts. This will
work in the future by making the canvas creation more flexible.
The camera is fixed, since otherwise it would smear the whole image.
